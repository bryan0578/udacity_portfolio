# udacity_portfolio
## Introduction
This portfolio was created as a project I completed for my Full Stack Developer nanodegree with Udacity. It contains all my projects I completed with Udacity and I will continue to update it further as more projects are completed. This project links all of my Udacity projects to Github so that you may look over my development process and see first hand how the projects were created and test them as well.

The scope of this project was to make a portfolio website to showcase all of my Udacity projects, but also optimize images for speed as well as give it a responsive design so that all the content renders on all devices well, such as mobile phones, tablets, and computers.
